TYPO3 Extension "Download Statistics"
=====================================

This extension logs all downloads served by EXT:fal_securedownload to a separate table and provides a backend module for displaying all downloads and exporting the list as Excel XML file.

Logging can be restricted to certain user groups by configuring these in the Extension Manager configuration (as comma-separated list of user groups).

* Developed for and tested with TYPO3 6.2
* Might work on 7.6 LTS
